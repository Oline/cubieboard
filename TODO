- Switching from linux-stable to : https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi (branches sunxi-3.0 and sunxi-3.4 should be stable.)

- customising MAC addr in the .fex file

- customising the network in the system (/etc/network/)

- Adding:

[dynamic]
MAC = "0123456789AB"

as a section to to .fex file before creating the script.bin

- Clean target for u-boot and kernel compile

- While kernel compile, can't find binary "mkimage" on the system. This binary
  can be found in u-boot-sunxi/tools/mkimage
  Should add this path to the PATH variable during the make compile???


- For OpenSuse chroot arm exec :

# zypper in qemu-linux-user
# qemu-binfmt-conf.sh
