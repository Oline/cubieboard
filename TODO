- customising MAC addr in the .fex file

- customising the network in the system (/etc/network/)

- Adding:

[dynamic]
MAC = "0123456789AB"

as a section to to .fex file before creating the script.bin

- While kernel compile, can't find binary "mkimage" on the system. This binary
  can be found in u-boot-sunxi/tools/mkimage
  Should add this path to the PATH variable during the make compile???

- For OpenSuse chroot arm exec :
http://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Chroot
# zypper in qemu-linux-user
# qemu-binfmt-conf.sh

- A way MUST be found to use only 1 files for variables between sh scripts and makefiles. I must be easy, it only needs to be done.
